# Codex Architect üß±üöÄ

**AI-assisted, effect-safe TypeScript architecture scaffolding ‚Äî powered by OpenAI Codex and [Effect](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect).**

Codex Architect helps developers go from plain-English specs to production-grade software architectures built with [Effect](https://effect.website), TypeScript‚Äôs most advanced functional programming framework.

It‚Äôs like having an engineering partner that understands your product vision and scaffolds modular, type-safe code you can build on ‚Äî not throw away.

## ‚ú® What It Does

- üß† **Understand your feature specs**  
  Describe what you want to build in natural language or YAML (e.g. "a task manager with user auth and a PostgreSQL backend")

- üèóÔ∏è **Generate clean architecture**  
  Codex synthesizes domain models, services, Effect-based layers, and module boundaries

- üí¨ **Talk to your architecture**  
  Add new features or modify behavior by chatting:  
  ‚ÄúAdd a password reset flow‚Äù ‚Üí it updates types, services, and DB access accordingly

- üîç **Validate with Codex**  
  Built-in review prompts check for type safety, modularity, and clean design

- üì¶ **Output working code**  
  You get a functional TypeScript project scaffold you can immediately run and evolve

## üí° Why This Project

Most AI code tools focus on short snippets or UI tricks. Codex Architect is different ‚Äî it helps you design and build real software systems that *scale*, using:
- üß¨ **Codex** for translating product intent into code
- üß™ **Effect** for managing side effects, resources, and composability
- üõ†Ô∏è **TypeScript** for type safety and DX

This project is fully open source and designed to grow with contributions from the Effect and AI dev communities.
